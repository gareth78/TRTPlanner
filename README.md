# TRT Planner

This project is a starter React + TypeScript application using Vite and Redux Toolkit. The Redux state is persisted to `localStorage` via `redux-persist`.

## Development

Run the setup script once to install dependencies, lint, format and start the dev server:

```bash
npm run setup
```

After the setup you can use the standard Vite scripts:

```bash
npm run dev       # start dev server
npm run build     # production build
npm run preview   # preview production build
npm run lint      # run ESLint
npm run format    # run Prettier
```

The application will display `Welcome to TRT Planner` and persist state across reloads.
